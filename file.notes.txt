PLOS thesaurus naming convention:

PLOS thesauri are named according to the format: plosthes.YYYY-n
Thus plosthes.2014-1 was the first version of the thesaurus built during calendar year 2014, with plosthes.2014-2 being the next.
The most recent version displayed corresponds to that behind the live PLOS journal web sites, as far as is possible.

Earlier versions (from throughout 2013) of the thesaurus can be made available, if useful.


This repository includes files of these formats:

plosthes.YYYY-n.full.xlsx:
The full Subject Area term list represented hierarchically by tier.

plosthes.YYYY-n.synonyms.xlsx:
The full Subject Area term list with corresponding synonymous terms, where relevant.

plosthes.YYYY-n.extract.xml:
The full thesaurus, listing:
<T>Term</T>
<BT>Broader Term</BT>
<NT>Narrower Term</NT>
<RT>Related Term</RT> [Not a priority for PLOS]
<Synonym>Synonym<Synonym>
<History>History</History> [Limited to changes made during the editorial lifetime of this version]
Internal Editorial Notes have been omitted.

plosthes.YYYY-n.SALPs.xlsx
A listing of Subject Area terms associated with PLOS ONE articles, paired with the corresponding Subject Area landing page from the PLOS ONE journal web site.
Note: Not all Subject Areas in the PLOS thesaurus are associated with a PLOS ONE article, so the number of rows in this file is exceeded by the total number of Subject Area terms in the corresponding thesaurus.
Note also that, rarely, a Subject Area landing page may be invoked for a particular thesaurus version subsequently to this download being prepared. This happens if a newly published article is assigned a Subject Area term that had previously not been used for a PLOS ONE article.
