PLOS thesaurus naming convention:

PLOS thesauri are named according to the format: plosthes.YYYY-n
Thus plosthes.2014-1 was the first version of the thesaurus built during calendar year 2014, with plosthes.2014-2 being the next.
The most recent version displayed corresponds to that behind the live PLOS journal web sites, as far as is possible.

Earlier versions (from throughout 2013) of the thesaurus can be made available, if useful.
